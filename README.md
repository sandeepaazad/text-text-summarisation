Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Text Summarization
This repository contains code for implementing a sequence-to-sequence model for text summarization using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset to generate concise summaries for given reviews.

Introduction
Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source text to create a condensed version, making it easier to comprehend. This project explores the implementation of a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism for text summarization tasks.
